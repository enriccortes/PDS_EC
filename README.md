Setup and Requirements

This repository was created using Python 3.12. Below are the libraries used in the exercises:

### Required Libraries

	•	Numpy: For numerical operations
	•	Scipy: For scientific computing
	•	Math: For basic mathematical functions (built-in)
	•	os: For file and directory operations (built-in)
	•	glob: For pattern matching in file names (built-in)
	•	shutil: For file operations like moving and copying files (built-in)
	•	json: For handling JSON files (built-in)
	•	pickle: For serializing and deserializing Python objects (built-in)
	•	Re: For regular expressions and text pattern matching (built-in)
	•	Time and Datetime: For working with dates and times (built-in)

All libraries used, except for Numpy and Scipy, come pre-installed with Python 3.12. If needed, you can install Numpy and Scipy using your preferred package manager.

### Exercises Overview

## Exercises_S1

Exercises_S1 covered key foundational topics such as syntax and variables, lists and dictionaries, tuples and sets, control flow, and functions. We also explored nested data structures and list comprehension, culminating in programming our first calculator. This assignment provided a comprehensive introduction to Python and its essential data structures.

Format: These exercises were completed in .py format.

## Exercises_S2

Exercises_S2 focused on building upon the skills gained in the first assignment. In this assignment, I created functions, performed basic data filtering, and developed practical applications like a to-do list and a temperature converter. These tasks allowed me to apply my knowledge to real-world problems and deepen my understanding of Python’s capabilities.

Format: These exercises were completed in .ipynb format for easier visualization.

## Exercises_S3

Exercises_S3 introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a new concept in our third week of exercises. This section includes theoretical explanations of this programming paradigm and four practical exercises where we create classes, objects, and methods to solve various tasks. This assignment helped solidify the application of OOP principles in Python.

Format: These exercises were completed in .ipynb format for easier visualization.

## Exercises_S4

In Exercises_S4, we learned how to use several essential Python libraries:

	1.	Numpy for numerical operations.
	2.	Scipy for scientific computing.
	3.	Math, os, glob, and shutil for various mathematical operations, file system navigation, file pattern matching, and file management.

These libraries provided powerful tools for performing complex calculations, managing files, and working with large datasets.

## Exercises_S5

In Exercises_S5, we expanded our knowledge of Python’s data handling and processing capabilities by learning about the following:

	1.	JSON, pickle, and parquet formats for storing and serializing data.
	2.	The Re library for regular expressions, enabling powerful text pattern matching.
	3.	Time and Datetime libraries for managing and manipulating date and time data.

These tools are essential for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation in data science projects.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the exercises completed, the skills acquired, and the tools learned throughout the course.
