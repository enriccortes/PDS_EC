## Introduction to My GitHub

This document outlines the exercises I have completed for my Python for Data Science class.

### **Exercises_S1**  
Exercises_S1 covered key foundational topics such as syntax and variables, lists and dictionaries, tuples and sets, control flow, and functions. We also explored nested data structures and list comprehension, culminating in programming our first calculator. This assignment provided a comprehensive introduction to Python and its essential data structures.  
- **Format:** These exercises were completed in `.py` format.

### **Exercises_S2**  
Exercises_S2 focused on building upon the skills gained in the first assignment. In this assignment, I created functions, performed basic data filtering, and developed practical applications like a to-do list and a temperature converter. These tasks allowed me to apply my knowledge to real-world problems and deepen my understanding of Python's capabilities.  
- **Format:** These exercises were completed in `.ipynb` format for easier visualization.

### **Exercises_S3**  
Exercises_S3 introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a new concept in our third week of exercises. This section includes theoretical explanations of this programming paradigm and four practical exercises where we create classes, objects, and methods to solve various tasks. This assignment helped solidify the application of OOP principles in Python.  
- **Format:** These exercises were completed in `.ipynb` format for easier visualization.

Additionally, I maintain a file titled **Python Notes**, where I record important concepts, code snippets, and insights from each session. This serves as a valuable resource for reviewing material and reinforcing my learning as I progress through the course.
